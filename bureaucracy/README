  Bureaucracy              16 Jul 2007

This is a "deleted scene" from the contest. Jason Reed originally
developed this proof of concept early on as we were brainstorming
various puzzles. There is a little demo puzzle (during this phase we
worked by making puzzles and sending out UM binaries to each other to
test) that you can try by running 'make' and then launching
bureaucracy.um in your Universal Machine.
