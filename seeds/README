  This is a "deleted scene" from the contest.  Check out notes.txt for some
  ideas about where we were going or seeds.sml for a sample implementation.
  If you're really into it, try writing an implementation of XOR (using the
  assembly language in seeds.sml) that computes the right answer 75% of the
  time.  It turns out we weren't the only ones with this idea:
