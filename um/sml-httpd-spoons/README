HTTPD UM Implementation

  This UM implementation acts an HTTP proxy server sitting between an ordinary
  web browser and Umix.  It uses Umix's telnet command to access the world
  wide web circa 19100 and make these pages available to modern clients.
  Tested with Firefox.  Running it with any UM binary besides Umix probably
  doesn't make sense.
