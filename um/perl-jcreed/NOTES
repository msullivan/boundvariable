This is a more or less direct perl port of the c-tom interpreter.

mistakes made:
* used "L*" instead of "N*" in pack, an endianness error
* nand used to be ~(r[b] & r[c]), instead of the correct
  expression 0xffffffff & ~(r[b] & r[c])
* similarly addition and multiplication I forgot to
  make mod 32.

In the self-test, a check to see if 0 = 0 would have caught
mistake number two. As it was, it resulted in a weird error
message. I think a check to see if 1 + (0 - 1) = 0 would catch
mistake number three.

performance:
hilariously bad.
minml.um takes about 9 seconds to run on my machine.

optimized it to 2 seconds. Perl's lack of an efficient
case construct is depressing. This is the best one I
could find, and it's still sensitive to the order of
cases. Moving the most common instruction (immediate load)
to the end of the list slows things down by like a factor
of 3.
