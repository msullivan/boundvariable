Description

  C7sus4 is a new Programming Language designed for low and medium-low
  level systems programming. With vastly improved syntax over previous
  language technologies, it will increase programmer productivity while
  increasing consumer confidence in Universal Machine applications.


Language Definition

  Any program accepted by the reference implementation ("ucc") shall
  be a valid C7sus4 program, and its behavior shall be defined to
  be the behavior of the output of the reference compiler, if any.
  Note: some programs may have undefined behavior.


Usage

  To compile a collection of C7sus4 source files into a UM binary,
  please issue the following command line at the UMIX prompt:

     ucc file1.c ... filen.c

  This will produce a file called a.um that can be run in any
  Universal Machine implementation.

  In the case that your files do not comprise a valid C7sus4,
  you will receive a helpful error message summarily rejecting
  your input.
