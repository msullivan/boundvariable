  This is a rudimentary assembler for the universal machine, which can
  be used to build standalone UM binaries. The code is not very convenient
  to use, because it requires the source assembly to be compiled into
  whistleock as SML code. From the SML/NJ prompt:

  CM.make "whistlock.cm";
  Compile.compile () "out.um";

  ... assembles whatever code is currently active (see compile.sml and the
  source files in code/) to the output file out.um.

  The name of this program is an "adventure" pun.
