bk-test-gen:
  A program written in sml to generate tests.
  Takes three command line arguments, width height freq
  ><s appear 1/freq of the time

  I've found that if you make the height around 30 or 40 lines and
  the frequency 4 or 5, you can sometimes get problems that stump
  the common solvers I've tried

bk-parse-test:
  This um program will take in a blackknots machine followed by a
  newline and output the final positions and number of plinks in the 
  appropriate form.

Note: the files in sols aren't actually used for anything, they are
just nice to have around.  Try to keep them up to date.
