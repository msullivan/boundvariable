To whom it may concern:

Guest access is provided as a courtesy to the community. We have
recently observed an increase in abuse using the guest account. For
example, the following sequence of commands obviously represents an
attempt to gain unauthorized access to the account "howie":

  cd code
  /bin/umodem hack.bas STOP
  /bin/qbasic hack.bas
  ls /home
  ./hack.exe howie
  
Moreover, the file that you uploaded with umodem appears to be 
corrupted and did not compile.

Please have respect for your fellow users,
