TESTING AUTOMATED E-MAIL SURVEY

This should be sent to users after they pass the 'arith' suite---
I only want responses from qualified people.  

FIXME: Before going live with this, I need to ask gardener and ohmega
about doing installations in guest accounts---I can't give out their
actual passwords!

Dear O'Cult User,

I'm thinking about extending O'Cult with other programming paradigms:

        two-dimensional-oriented programming
                login: ohmega           password: bidirectional

        bug-oriented programming
                login: gardener         password: mathemantica
				   
Since you're such a good O'Cult programmer, I'd welcome your advice
(heh!) on how to do so.  Because these languages are not yet publicly
available, you'll have to log in using the above accounts to run the
research prototypes.

-Harmonious
