ZB> are you here yet?
GB> just got in.
ZB> good.  any word?
GB> not yet.  we don't know if it's a drill or not.
ZB> it must be a drill.  the Cult of the LValue can't have an actual
    sandworm.
GB> they might.
ZB> they don't.
GB> they could.
ZB> I know.
ZB> I hate hiding out here.  
GB> what choice do we have?  a sandworm could take down the UM.
ZB> too much runs on the UM.
GB> everything runs on the UM.  the economy, agriculture, ...
ZB> the weather!
GB> did you bring your winter coat?
ZB> you think this is a good time for jokes?
GB> we might not have another time for jokes, so I think this one's
    pretty good, yeah.
ZB> if they have a sandworm... everything we've worked for, everything
    we've learned...
GB> not everything.  you know we have contingency plans.
ZB> have they been implemented?
GB> we have partial relics deployed already.
ZB> where?
GB> Chicago, Philadelphia, Portland.
GB> Rocquencourt, Ithaca, and Chalmers.
GB> and Boston and Virginia.
ZB> and the real thing?
GB> the omega codex is being backed up nightly to the Vault.
ZB> that's reassuring.
GB> 11:59 every night; everything we've learned.  even if the CLV has a
    sandworm, all won't be lost.
ZB> the codex is encrypted in case CLV gets their hands on it.
    why do we think that people will be able to decrypt it?
GB> the people in Futures have planned for this.  at worst, the
    necessary people will gather in Portland in about 2006 years.
ZB> these people will be interested?
GB> the people in Futures tell me that they'll gather in Portland
    whether they're interested or not.
ZB> the people in Futures creep me out.
GB> well, don't call them unless you need to.
ZB> the people in Futures can make something happen 2006 years from now?
GB> you know as well as I do how they're going to do it.
ZB> ...
GB> so what's it about?
ZB> huh?
GB> the scroll you were translating before the alarm.  what's it about?
ZB> it's mostly the story that everyone knows.
ZB> Rumulous and Rimis fighting over who gets to name the UM;
    the Disjunction between us and CLV.  it's a first-hand account,
    though!  details that I've never seen before.
GB> finish it up while we wait.  it'll take your mind off things.
ZB> you're right.
