Dear Bill,

I hope that you never read this.

This is an automated message sent in the event that neither Betty nor
I have logged into UMIX for at least 60 days. It has been 

-6241731

days since one of us last logged on. Something must be wrong; you know
that the cult has its enemies. There's probably nothing you can do for
us now, except to make sure that our research into programming
languages is not lost. I've attached our passwords below... please, if
you can, carry on with our research, and make sure the world knows
what we've done!

Farewell friend,
