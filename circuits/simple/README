    "Simple" compiler to 2D               16 Jul 2007


This is Tom's attempt at a compiler from MinML to 2D. I believe that
the layout engine works, but that the minml compiler suffers a problem
with control dependencies and so is incorrect. I gave up on it to work
on other puzzles because Karl implemented his own working compiler.

A working minml implementation of the raytracer is in the parent
directory.
