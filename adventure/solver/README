This directory contains various tools used to help create the puzzles
for the adventure game.  Puzzles were created in part by computer (to
try to fool humans) and by humans (to fool computers).  There are
tools to generate valid puzzles (mostly generator.sml) as well as
solvers (solver.sml) that were used to assess the difficulty of
particular problem instances.  proof.sml contains the datatype
definitions and a verifier -- it is also a good place to start reading
if you want to understand any of this code.  Most of the other files
are probably impenetrable, especially any that are "awesome" or
"ultra-something."
