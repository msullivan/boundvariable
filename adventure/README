    The Adventure Game                               16 Jul 2007

Find proofs in a restricted logic to build "items" in a fictional
robot-inhabitied universe to reprogram your own brain.  Then defeat an
oppressive bureaucracy by outmaneuvering a broken information-flow system.

The main source files for the Adventure game are described below.

adventure.uh

  Start here -- this is the main entry point to this game, used both by Umix
  and main.uml.  It defines many of the important types and includes the main
  evaluation loop.

populate.uh

  Set up the initial state of the robot world, including the puzzles.

english-parse.uh

  A parser for the English-like commands issued by a player while playing the
  game (e.g. go north, take pamphlet).

rml*

  Definition and implementation of the Robot Mind Language.  This is another
  ML-like language that is used to interpret English commands given by the
  player and then make changes to the state of the robot world.  Though the game
  always uses this interpreter, it's not obvious to players until they've used
  the downloader to see the robot's current "mind."

goggles.uh

  Take the results of the interpreting the a given command and present it to
  the player in one of a number of easy to read forms.

puz-*.uh

  Puzzles used in the game.

nouns/adjectives/rooms

  Define the datatypes and functions used to describe the state of the world.
